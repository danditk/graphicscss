Graphics and animations in CSS by KODILLA.com

.Intro
This course aims to teach me how to create CSS animations and graphic effects while maintaining good practices and compatibility with various browsers.
I will get to know deeply the principles of operation of CSS transitions, 2D and 3D transformation, and also an extensive lesson about filters and gradients.
A large part of the course are also CSS animations in which they show me from scratch how to build great animations without a lot of work..
